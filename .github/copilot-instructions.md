# Workspace Instructions (React + simple UI)

- Keep the React code simple and readable.
- Put each UI component in its own folder under `src/components`.
- Avoid extra pages/features beyond the single dashboard.
- Prefer plain CSS (no CSS-in-JS).
- Keep mock data colocated in the page/component where used.
